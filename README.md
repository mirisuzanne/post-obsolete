# The Obsolete Book in a Post-Obsolete World, as Represented by a Post-Obsolete Book About Dance.
**(An Archival Rhizome Ecology in Ten Parts,
and A Reflection on the Obsolescence of Obsolescence,
Documented on the Cloud,
and Open-Sourced as a Defense Against Post-Post-Obsolescence).**

## 1. Books are Obsolete.
I don't think we have to discuss this,
it's so obvious that everyone agrees.
[Allwaswell934][youtube] (on YouTube) agrees.

Books are so obsolete that I couldn't find any,
so I decided to create one
through the power of transubstantiation.

## 2. The Book as Word
I don't have the blood of Christ
for proper transubstantiation,
so instead I brought a word.

Perhaps words are the blood of books?

I brought the word "Rhizome"
because everyone is using it so much,
I figured there would be enough to go around.

[_Have the class recite the word "rhizome"_]

## 3. The Word as Definition
We can do better.
What we really need is the blood of words.
Perhaps the blood of a word is it's definition?

**Rhizome**: _noun_.
"A rootlike subterranean stem,
commonly horizontal in position,
that usually produces roots below
and sends up shoots progressively
from the upper surface."

Used in a sentence:
"With a knife,
cut the parent rhizome into segments,
so each has its own leaf fan."

## 4. Definition as Meaning
I don't know what that means: "it's own leaf fan".

What we really need isn't the definition,
but the meaning,
and not just the meaning of one word,
but all the meanings of all the words.

We need the very concept of "meaning".

## 5. Meaning Made Pen
I realize "The Concept of Meaning" is a bit abstract,
so I decided to give it form
through the transubstantiation
of a pen.

[_Produce a pen_]

Now this pen is the avatar of meaning,
representing the word "rhizome",
as defined above,
which is (in turn) an obsolete book.

## 6. Pen Made Obsolete
But pens also seem obsolete,
replaced by computers.

I didn't write this by hand,
I wrote it on my laptop.

## 7. This is a Side Note (sorry (sorrysorry))
The obsolescence of the pen
doesn't stop me from carrying one in my pocket every day,
everywhere I go,
and using it on occasion to take notes
on this paper that I also carry with me.

[_Ask the class to produce pen and paper_]

It's like obsolescence doesn't make a thing obsolete,
it just helps define more specific use cases.

Once an object is obsolete
I am free to use it, or not use it,
as I see fit,
Any time I want.

We're off topic.

## 8. The Pen Made Computer Made Cloud Made Architecture
The pen is (at best) post-obsolete,
so I'm replacing the pen with a Computer,
which I've replaced with "the cloud"
(which is where this document lives).

But the cloud is really just a set of protocols for the networking of servers,
which live on server farms,
which are simply warehouses,
which is a type of architecture.

## 9. Architecture as the Obsolete Book
Since we have architecture all around us,
we can just use that.

**Through the power of transubstantiation (Domine Dei) I declare this room to be an obsolete book.**

## 10. Conclusion: A Ritual Dance in Memory of Books-cum-Architecture
So, I've prepared a ritual
around the architecture of this room:
a dance about architecture,
if you will.

Luckily I have a book called
"How to Dance"
(probably the most obsolete book I own)
and it has instructions for a Waltz.

The Waltz is a simple 3/4 Beat
Da-Da-Dat Da-Da-Dat Da-Da-Dat

[_Dance the Waltz as a class, slow._]

That's morse code for "oooooooo",
the sound you should make durring ritual dances
for obsolete books,
made post-obsolete by their use in rituals
memorializing the death of books.

You could also go faster:
Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit
or "ssssssss"
like the snake of online publishing.

[_Dance the Waltz as a class, fast._]

Or combine the two
(fast, slow, fast)
Di-Di-Dit Da-Da-Dat Di-Di-Dit,
an SOS cry for help,
as the book dies a slow,
painful, hideous death.

**A Sonnet:**
> Death, be not proud, though some have called thee     <br />
Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;               <br />
For those whom thou think'st thou dost over throw       <br />
Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.        <br />
From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,         <br />
Much pleasure - then, from thee much more must flow;    <br />
And soonest our best men with thee do go,               <br />
Rest of their bones and soul's delivery.                <br />
Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings and desperate men, <br />
And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell;           <br />
And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well,          <br />
And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then?     <br />
One short sleep past, we wake eternally,                <br />
And death shall be no more. Death thou shalt die.

> – John Donne
