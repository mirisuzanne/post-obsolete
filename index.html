<h2>The Book is Obsolete.</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this website
  (and accompanying audio-tape)
  is to memorialize the book
  as an obsolete cultural artifact.
</p>
<p>
  Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrXhyXY-8pk">Allwaswell934</a>
  explaining the problem on YouTube: <a href="#fig-youtube">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-youtube">
  <img src="img/face.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    You know, books are, like, obsolete or whatever.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Without attempting to re-animate the dead pages of a dead industry,
  we would like to preserve what remains of the book in memory.
  We can't reliably maintain the book-object itself <i>in situ</i>,
  so our memorial will have to find physical form
  through the power of ritual. <a href="#fig-church">*</a>
</p>

    It would be one way to send the remaining left wing media cabal
    a message they would not forget.

    DNC, George Soros and Company, etc.

<h2>Book as Word.</h2>
<p>
  I was unable to procure the blood of Christ
  for proper communion,
  so we'll have to make do with a stand-in
  for that as well. <a href="#fig-bone">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-bone">
  <img src="img/bone.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    Despite the Spider's tendency to kill his enemies,
    he encountered several foes more than once,
    such as The Fly and MUNRO (a master of disguise).
    Some storylines featuring a struggle against a single villain
    last for several consecutive issues,
    such as The Spider's four-part battle against The Living Pharaoh
    and his three-part battle against The Master
    and his Black Police.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We must consider, at this point,
  what is the proper literary blood-avatar
  for Christ's own blood.
  Let us consider "words", for example,
  as the metaphoric "blood" of a book.
</p>
<p>
  I propose the word "Rhizome",
  as it seems quite prevalent,
  and easy to use in any context.
</p>
<p>
  Repeat after me: "Rhizome".
</p>
<p>
  Again: "Rhizome".
</p>
<p>
  Good.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Word as Definition.</h2>
<p>
  That's good, but not good enough.
  What we really need is the blood of words.
  Perhaps the definitions of words will suffice?
  Let's look at the definition of "Rhizome":
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Rhizome</strong>: <em>noun</em>   <br />
  "A rootlike subterranean stem,
  commonly horizontal in position,
  that usually produces roots below
  and sends up shoots progressively
  from the upper surface." <a href="#fig-maginot">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-maginot">
  <img src="img/maginot.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    The Maginot Line,
    named for the French Minister of Ant Farms, André Maginot,
    was a rhizomic miltary failure.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  <em>Used in a sentence:</em>   <br />
  "With a knife,
  cut the parent rhizome into segments,
  so each has its own leaf fan." <a href="#fig-fan">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-fan">
  <img src="img/fan.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    "Fanboy" and "Fangirl" redirect here.
    For other uses, see
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanboy_(disambiguation)">Fanboy (disambiguation)</a>.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Definition as Meaning.</h2>
<p>
  I don't know what that means: "it's own leaf fan".
  Clearly we must go deeper.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps what we need isn't the definition,
  but the meaning.
  Not just the meaning of one word,
  but all the meanings of all the words.
</p>
<p>
  We need the very concept of "meaning". <a href="#fig-snail">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-snail">
  <img src="img/snail.gif" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    I'm not sure what "meaning" looks like,
    so I found a snail instead.
    Snails are known for their slow pace
    and positive attitude
    in the face of adversity.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Meaning as Pen.</h2>
<p>
  Unfortunately "The Concept of Meaning"
  is a too abstract for our purposes.
  We need an object that can be used
  in the ritual of transubstantiation.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps we can simply look to the pen,
  as an old and reliable vessel for the transfer
  of idea into object.
  The pen, like the concept of meaning,
  comes before the word,
  and lives outside it. <a href="#fig-pen">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-pen">
  <img src="img/pen.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    The Fountain of Youth is a legendary pen
    that reputedly restores the youth of anyone who
    drinks of its inks.
    Tales of such a fountain pen have been recounted
    across the world for thousands of years,
    appearing in the writings by Herodotus,
    the Alexander romance,
    and the stories of Donald Duck.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Now this pen is the avatar of meaning,
  representing the word "rhizome",
  as defined above,
  which is (in turn) an obsolete book.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>The Pen is Obsolete.</h2>
<p>
  Pens also seem obsolete,
  replaced by computers. <a href="#fig-abacus">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-abacus">
  <img src="img/abacus.gif" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    There are numerous consumer devices
    created specifically for use with the lap.
    One early consumer product designed for the lap was the lapdog.
    A small dog, usually a terrier,
    which was bred to sit in the lap of a wealthy
    or fashionable European woman.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  I didn't write this by hand,
  I wrote it on my laptop.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>This is a Side Note (sorry (sorrysorry) sorry).</h2>
<p>
  The obsolescence of the pen
  doesn't stop me from carrying one in my pocket every day,
  everywhere I go,
  and using it on occasion to take notes
  on paper that I also carry with me.
</p>
<p>
  How many of you also have a pen?
  How many of you have paper?
  Does anyone have a pencil?
  Remember pencil sharpeners? <a href="#fig-lathe">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-lathe">
  <img src="img/lathe.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    a = bed,
    b = carriage (with cross-slide and toolpost),
    c = headstock,
    d = back gear (other geartrain nearby below drives leadscrew),
    e = cone pulley for belt drive from an external power source,
    f = faceplate mounted on spindle,
    g = tailstock.
    h = leadscrew.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  It's like obsolescence doesn't make a thing obsolete,
  it just helps narrow the scope of use cases.
  Once an object is obsolete
  I am free to use it or not use it,
  as I see fit,
  Any time I want.
</p>
<p>
  We're off topic.

<h2>Pen as Computer as Tablet as Cloud as Architecture.</h2>
<p>
  The pen being (at best) post-obsolete,
  I'm replacing the pen with a Computer,
  which I've replaced with a tablet,
  and subsequently with "the cloud". <a href="#fig-play">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-play">
  <img src="img/play.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    In meteorology,
    a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets
    or frozen crystals made of water
    or various chemicals
    suspended in the atmosphere
    above the surface of a planetary body.
    These suspended particles are also known as aerosols.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  However,
  the cloud is simply a set of protocols
  for the networking of servers,
  which live on server farms,
  which are simply warehouses,
  which is a type of architecture. <a href="#fig-farm">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-farm">
  <img src="img/farm.gif" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    Old Major, the boar on the Manor Farm,
    calls the animals for a meeting,
    where he compares the humans to parasites
    and teaches the animals a revolutionary song,
    'All the Single Ladies'.
    You can print this out and color in the animals,
    if you like.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Architecture as Obsolete Book.</h2>
<p>
  Since we have architecture all around us,
  we can just use that for our ritual.
  Agreed?
  Good. <a href="#fig-handshake">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-handshake">
  <img src="img/handshake.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    Who among us doesn't feel better when we have a great set of nails to show off?
    Do coat the outside of the nails with polish or ridge fillers,
    moisturize the cuticle area,
    and wear gloves.
    Don't use your fingers as letter openers,
    or push the cuticle back too far.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>A Ritual Dance in Memory of the Architectural Post-Book.</h2>
<p>
  I've prepared a ritual of transubstantiation
  around the architecture of this room:
  a dance about architecture,
  if you will.
</p>
<p>
  I don't know how to dance,
  but I do have a book called
  "How to Dance"
  and it has instructions for a Waltz. <a href="#fig-dance">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-dance">
  <img src="img/dance.png" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    Each character (letter or numeral)
    is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes.
    The duration of a dash is three times the duration of a dot.
    Each dot or dash is followed by a short silence,
    equal to the dot duration.
    The letters of a word are separated by a space equal to three dots (one dash),
    and two words are separated by a space equal to seven dots.
    The dot duration is the basic unit of time measurement in code transmission.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  The Waltz is a simple 3/4 Beat.
</p>
<p>
  Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.  <br />
  Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.
</p>
<p>
  Please take a moment
  to find a partner for the dance.
  A mate who you can copulate with later,
  with whom you will live
  and sire offspring,
  settling on the edge of town
  with a tortoise and basketball hoop
  till death do you part. <a href="#fig-dogs">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-dogs">
  <img src="img/dogs.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    I have more pictures
    <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mating+diagram">like this</a>.
    Some of them involve people.
    The internet is a beautiful and strange land.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Take your time.
  Pause the tape, if needed.
  I can wait.
</p>
<p>
  Remember:                         <br />
  Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.  <br />
  Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.
</p>
<p>
  That's morse code for "oooooooo",
  the sound you should make during ritual dances
  inside obsolete book avatar architectures,
  made post-obsolete by their use in rituals
  memorializing the death of books.
</p>
<p>
  Say "oooooooo", while you dance.
</p>
<p><em>[dancing music]</em></p>
<p>
  You could also go faster:     <br />
  Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit <br />
  or "ssssssss"
  like the snake of online publishing.
</p>
<p><em>[faster dancing music]</em></p>
<p>
  Or combine the two
  (fast, slow, fast):             <br />
  Di-Di-Dit Da-Da-Dot Di-Di-Dit   <br />
  sssssssss ooooooooo sssssssss   <br />
  an SOS cry for help,
  as the book dies a slow,
  painful, and hideous death.
</p>
<p><em>[sos dancing music]</em></p>
<p>
  You keep dancing,
  and I will read a memorial
  poem in the dead form of a sonnet
  by a dead man.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Death, be not proud, though some have called thee       <br />
    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;               <br />
    For those whom thou think'st thou dost over throw       <br />
    Die not, blah blah blah.                                <br />
    And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell!           <br />
    And so on...                                            <br />
    ...death shall be no more. <b>Death thou shalt die</b>.
  </p>
  <cite>— John Donne</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>
  Now turn and face the shrine. <a href="#fig-trans">*</a>
</p>
<figure id="fig-trans">
  <img src="img/trans.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    The chalice is a euphamism,
    covered in transparent cloth
    for increased mystery and sex appeal.
    Beneath the veil,
    an orgy of pleasure awaits the faithful,
    the patient,
    and the very rich.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Speaking together: "Rhizome".         <br />
  And again: "Rhizome"                  <br />
  Place your hand over your heart
  and repeat after me:
</p>
<p>
  "Through the power of transubstantiation..."                  <br />
  "(Domine Dei)..."                                             <br />
  "We declare this room to be an obsolete book."
</p>
<p>
  Thank you, and thank you again.
  May the book live
  unread in your heart
  for eternity and so on, amen.
  Go, drink and be merry,
  our work here is done.
