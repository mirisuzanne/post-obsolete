<h2>Books are Obsolete.</h2>
<p>
  I don't think we have to discuss this,
  it's so obvious that everyone agrees.
  Here is <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrXhyXY-8pk">Allwaswell934</a>
  explaining the problem on YouTube (figure 1):
</p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/BrXhyXY-8pk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>
  Books are so obsolete that I couldn't find one,
  so we will need to create one
  through the power of transubstantiation (figure 2).
</p>

  <figcaption>
    <em>fig.2</em>
    The entire area is connected with lines,
    and numbered for consistent reference.

</figure>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>The Book as Word</h2>
<p>
  I was unable to procure the blood of Christ
  for proper communion (figure 3),
  so we'll have to make do with a stand-in.
</p>
<figure id="fig3">
  <img src="img/drinkingblood.jpg" alt="" />
  <figcaption>
    <em>fig.3</em>
    Keep a napkin close, as blood can cause difficult stains.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  We must consider, at this point,
  what is the proper literary blood-avatar
  for Christ's own blood.
  For example, let us consider "words"
  as the metaphoric "blood" of a book.
</p>
<p>
  I'll propose the word "Rhizome",
  as it seems quite prevolent,
  and easy to use in any context.
</p>
<p>
  Repeat after me: "Rhizome". <br />
  Again: "Rhizome".           <br />
  Good.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>The Word as Definition</h2>
<p>
  We can do better.
  What we really need is the blood of words.
  Perhaps the blood of a word is it's definition?
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Rhizome</strong>: <em>noun</em>   <br />
  "A rootlike subterranean stem,
  commonly horizontal in position,
  that usually produces roots below
  and sends up shoots progressively
  from the upper surface."
</p>
<p>
  Used in a sentence:   <br />
  "With a knife,
  cut the parent rhizome into segments,
  so each has its own leaf fan."
  <small>(<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rhizome">Dictionary.com</a>)</small>
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Definition as Meaning</h2>
<p>
  I don't know what that means: "it's own leaf fan".
</p>
<p>
  What we really need isn't the definition,
  but the meaning,
  and not just the meaning of one word,
  but all the meanings of all the words.
</p>
<p>
  We need the very concept of "meaning".
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Meaning Made Pen</h2>
<p>
  I realize "The Concept of Meaning" is a bit abstract,
  so I decided to give it form
  through the transubstantiation
  of a pen.
</p>
<p>
  [_Produce a pen_]
</p>
<p>
  Now this pen is the avatar of meaning,
  representing the word "rhizome",
  as defined above,
  which is (in turn) an obsolete book.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Pen Made Obsolete</h2>
<p>
  But pens also seem obsolete,
  replaced by computers.
</p>
<p>
  I didn't write this by hand,
  I wrote it on my laptop.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>This is a Side Note (sorry (sorrysorry))</h2>
<p>
  The obsolescence of the pen
  doesn't stop me from carrying one in my pocket every day,
  everywhere I go,
  and using it on occasion to take notes
  on this paper that I also carry with me.
</p>
<p>
  [_Ask the class to produce pen and paper_]
</p>
<p>
  It's like obsolescence doesn't make a thing obsolete,
  it just helps define more specific use cases.
</p>
<p>
  Once an object is obsolete
  I am free to use it, or not use it,
  as I see fit,
  Any time I want.
</p>
<p>
  We're off topic.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>The Pen Made Computer Made Cloud Made Architecture</h2>
<p>
  The pen is (at best) post-obsolete,
  so I'm replacing the pen with a Computer,
  which I've replaced with "the cloud"
  (which is where this document lives).
</p>
<p>
  But the cloud is really just a set of protocols for the networking of servers,
  which live on server farms,
  which are simply warehouses,
  which is a type of architecture.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Architecture as the Obsolete Book</h2>
<p>
  Since we have architecture all around us,
  we can just use that.
</p>
<p>
  Through the power of transubstantiation
  (Domine Dei)
  I declare this room to be an obsolete book.
</p>

<!-- SECTION -->
<h2>Conclusion: A Ritual Dance in Memory of Books-cum-Architecture</h2>
<p>
  So, I've prepared a ritual
  around the architecture of this room:
  a dance about architecture,
  if you will.
</p>
<p>
  Luckily I have a book called
  "How to Dance"
  (probably the most obsolete book I own)
  and it has instructions for a Waltz.
</p>
<p>
  The Waltz is a simple 3/4 Beat
  Da-Da-Dat Da-Da-Dat Da-Da-Dat
</p>
<p>
  [_Dance the Waltz as a class, slow._]
</p>
<p>
  That's morse code for "oooooooo",
  the sound you should make durring ritual dances
  for obsolete books,
  made post-obsolete by their use in rituals
  memorializing the death of books.
</p>
<p>
  You could also go faster:
  Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit
  or "ssssssss"
  like the snake of online publishing.
</p>
<p>
  [_Dance the Waltz as a class, fast._]
</p>
<p>
  Or combine the two
  (fast, slow, fast)
  Di-Di-Dit Da-Da-Dat Di-Di-Dit,
  an SOS cry for help,
  as the book dies a slow,
  painful, hideous death.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>A Sonnet:</strong>
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    Death, be not proud, though some have called thee       <br />
    Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;               <br />
    For those whom thou think'st thou dost over throw       <br />
    Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.        <br />
    From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,         <br />
    Much pleasure - then, from thee much more must flow;    <br />
    And soonest our best men with thee do go,               <br />
    Rest of their bones and soul's delivery.                <br />
    Thou'rt slave to fate, chance, kings and desperate men, <br />
    And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell;           <br />
    And poppy or charms can make us sleep as well,          <br />
    And better than thy stroke. Why swell'st thou then?     <br />
    One short sleep past, we wake eternally,                <br />
    And death shall be no more. Death thou shalt die.
  </p>
  <cite>â€” John Donne</cite>
