      The Fountain of Youth is a legendary pen

      Tales of such a fountain pen have been recounted

      comes before the word,

      Take your time.
      Pause the tape, if needed.
      I can wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember:                         <br />
      Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.  <br />
      Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.

      That's morse code for "oooooooo",
      the sound you should make during ritual dances
      inside obsolete book avatar architectures,
      made post-obsolete by their use in rituals
      memorializing the death of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say "oooooooo", while you dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could also go faster:     <br />
      Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit <br />
      or "ssssssss"
      like the snake of online publishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or combine the two
      (fast, slow, fast):             <br />
      Di-Di-Dit Da-Da-Dot Di-Di-Dit   <br />
      sssssssss ooooooooo sssssssss   <br />
      an SOS cry for help,
      as the book dies a slow,
      painful, and hideous death.
    </p>
    <p>
      You keep dancing,
      and I will read a memorial
      poem in the dead form of a sonnet
      by a dead man.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Death, be not proud, though some have called thee       <br />
        Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;               <br />
        For those whom thou think'st thou dost over throw       <br />
        Die not, blah blah blah.                                <br />
        And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell!           <br />
        And so on...                                            <br />
        ...death shall be no more. <b>Death thou shalt die</b>.
      </p>
      <cite>— John Donne</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Now turn and face the shrine.

      The chalice is a euphamism,
      covered in transparent cloth
      for increased mystery and sex appeal.
      Beneath the veil,
      an orgy of pleasure awaits the faithful,
      the patient,
      and the very rich.

      Speaking together: "Rhizome".         <br />

      Place your hand over your heart

      Thank you, and thank you again.
      May the book live
      unread in your heart
      for eternity and so on, amen.
      Go, drink and be merry,
      our work here is done.
