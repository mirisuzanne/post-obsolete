      Some of them involve people.
      The internet is a beautiful and strange land.

      Take your time.
      Pause the tape, if needed.
      I can wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remember:                         <br />
      Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.  <br />
      Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot, Da-Da-Dot.

      That's morse code for "oooooooo",
      the sound you should make during ritual dances
      inside obsolete book avatar architectures,
      made post-obsolete by their use in rituals
      memorializing the death of books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say "oooooooo", while you dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could also go faster:     <br />
      Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit Di-Di-Dit <br />
      or "ssssssss"
      like the snake of online publishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or combine the two
      (fast, slow, fast):             <br />
      Di-Di-Dit Da-Da-Dot Di-Di-Dit   <br />
      sssssssss ooooooooo sssssssss   <br />
      an SOS cry for help,
      as the book dies a slow,
      painful, and hideous death.
    </p>
    <p>
      You keep dancing,
      and I will read a memorial
      poem in the dead form of a sonnet
      by a dead man.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Death, be not proud, though some have called thee       <br />
        Mighty and dreadful, for thou art not so;               <br />
        For those whom thou think'st thou dost over throw       <br />
        Die not, blah blah blah.                                <br />
        And dost with poison, war and sickness dwell!           <br />
        And so on...                                            <br />
        ...death shall be no more. <b>Death thou shalt die</b>.
      </p>
      <cite>— John Donne</cite>

      Now turn and face the shrine.

      The chalice is a euphamism,
      covered in transparent cloth
      for increased mystery and sex appeal.
      Beneath the veil,
      an orgy of pleasure awaits the faithful,
      the patient,
      and the very rich.

      Speaking together: "Rhizome".         <br />
      And again: "Rhizome"                  <br />
      Place your hand over your heart
      and repeat after me:

      "Through the power of transubstantiation..."                  <br />

      Thank you, and thank you again.
      May the book live
      unread in your heart
      for eternity and so on, amen.
      Go, drink and be merry,
      our work here is done.
